# WaveFunctionCollapse
Credit and idea comes from: https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse <- This is basically the same thing.

Generates all posible states and adjacencies. Iterates through a 2D array, collapsing the wave funcion (obeserving a state) at each position and placing the observed state at the position
